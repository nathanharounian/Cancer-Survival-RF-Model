# Cancer-Survival-RF-Model

Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), conducted EDA to find a good classifying threshold between ‘high’ and ‘low’ survival. Then, conducted data cleaning by either imputing or removing NA values. Finally, found the most important covariates (genes) through PCA, fit a Random Forest using 10-fold Cross Validation, resulting in a final classifying model with 91% test set accuracy and a Kappa Statistic of 67%.
